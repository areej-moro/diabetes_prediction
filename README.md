This project implements a hybrid diabetes prediction system combining a Neural Network (NN) and Fuzzy Logic using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The system predicts diabetes risk with high accuracy by leveraging machine learning for pattern recognition and fuzzy logic for interpretable risk assessment. It includes robust data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly Tkinter-based GUI for real-time predictions.

## Project Overview
Diabetes is a critical global health issue, and early prediction can facilitate timely interventions. This project combines:
- **Neural Network**: Captures complex patterns in patient data for binary classification (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic).
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Incorporates expert knowledge to handle uncertainty and provide interpretable risk scores.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines NN probabilities with fuzzy risk scores for enhanced prediction accuracy.

The system processes patient features (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, Age) to predict diabetes risk. It includes a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, outliers, and class imbalance, and a GUI for user-friendly predictions.


## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles missing values and zeros using Iterative Imputer.
  - Removes outliers with Isolation Forest.
  - Feature engineering: Interaction terms (Glucose_BMI, Insulin_Pedigree), log transformations, and categorical features (Obesity_Category, Age_Group).
  - Balances classes using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
  - Feature selection with Mutual Information, retaining key features for both NN and fuzzy systems.
- **Neural Network**:
  - Enhanced architecture with dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization.
  - Class weighting to address class imbalance.
  - K-Fold cross-validation and early stopping for robust training.
- **Fuzzy Logic System**:
  - Uses 48 expert-defined rules based on Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, Age, and NN risk probability.
  - Outputs interpretable risk scores (Low, Medium, High).
- **Ensemble Prediction**:
  - Combines NN and fuzzy outputs for improved accuracy.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1-score.
  - Visualizations: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, training history, and score distributions.
- **GUI**:
  - Tkinter-based interface for inputting patient data and viewing predictions.
  - Displays NN probability, fuzzy risk score/label, and ensemble prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Imbalanced-learn
  - Fuzzy Logic: Scikit-fuzzy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - GUI: Tkinter, Pillow (for intro image)
- **Environment**: Python 3.12+ (tested on Windows)
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter for preprocessing and model training

## Dataset
The project uses the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) with 769 records and 9 features:
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- **Target**: Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)
- **Download**: Place `pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv` in the project root.

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- Converts non-numeric values to numeric, replacing invalid entries with medians.
- Imputes zeros in Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI using Iterative Imputer.
- Removes ~5% outliers using Isolation Forest.
- Adds derived features: Glucose_BMI, Insulin_Pedigree, Log_Insulin, Log_DiabetesPedigree.
- Creates categorical features: Obesity_Category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), Age_Group (Young, Middle-Aged, Senior).
- Applies SMOTE for class balancing (sampling strategy=0.8).
- Selects top features using Mutual Information, ensuring fuzzy-required features (Glucose, BMI, BloodPressure, Age) are retained.
- Scales features using StandardScaler.
